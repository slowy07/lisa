            This test case verifies if ring buffer settings can be changed with ethtool.

            Steps:
            1. Get the current ring buffer settings.
            2. Change the rx and tx value to new_values using ethtool.
            3. Get the settings again and validate the current rx and tx
                values are equal to the new_values assigned.
            4. Revert back the rx and tx value to their orginal values.
